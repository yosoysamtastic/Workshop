## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves   
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:   
All mimsy were the borogoves,   
      And the mome raths outgrabe.   

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!   

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,   
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make   
      The billows smooth and bright —   
And this was odd, because it was   
      The middle of the night.   

The moon was shining sulkily,   
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there   
      After the day was done —   
"It's very rude of him," she said,   
      "To come and spoil the fun."   
      
## Last Verse

THE CAT IN THE HAT  

Then our mother came in  
And she said to us two,  
“Did you have any fun?  
Tell me. What did you do?”  

And Sally and I did not  
know what to say.  
Should we tell her  
The things that went on  
there that day?  

Well... what would YOU do  
If your mother asked you?
